Code Review Summary
1. Model Structure
Original: The model combines everything into one layer.

Revised: Introduced a medallion architecture, splitting the model into bronze and gold layers.

Explanation: This organization makes the pipeline clearer and more modular. Separate layers for raw data and transformations improve maintainability and scalability, making the workflow easier to debug and extend.

2. Maintainability
Original: Utilized SELECT *, which poses risks if source tables change.

Revised: Selected only necessary columns to improve clarity and protect against future changes.

Explanation: Using SELECT * introduces potential issues if the schema of source tables changes unexpectedly. By selecting explicit columns, the code becomes more intentional and maintainable, reducing the risk of breakages when changes occur.

3. Performance
Original: A cross join between date_spine and products could cause performance degradation.

Revised: Replaced the cross join with a more efficient inner join. Also, added incremental logic for improved performance.

Explanation: Cross joins can create massive result sets, slowing down queries. Replacing it with an inner join reduces the dataset size and speeds up the query. Additionally, incremental logic ensures only new or changed data is processed, optimizing performance further.

4. Data Integrity
Original: No data quality checks were implemented.

Revised: Added data tests to validate relationships, enhancing data integrity. Incorporated utility and expectation packages.

Explanation: Data quality checks ensure consistency and reliability in the data pipeline. By adding tests and leveraging dbtâ€™s utilities, potential issues like broken relationships or missing data can be caught early, preserving data integrity for accurate reporting.

5. Best Practices
Revised:
Added a macro to encapsulate complex logic, promoting reuse.
Implemented a pre-commit hook for code quality, ensuring models are described and pass linting before merging.
Added a .github folder with a PR template for standardized contributions.
Created a workflow for the pre-commit hook on GitHub for consistency.
Added Spectacles tests for LookerML to automate testing of Looker models.
Explanation: Macros improve code reuse and modularity, while pre-commit hooks and PR templates ensure code quality and consistency across submissions. Spectacles tests automate validation in Looker, further enhancing reliability.
6. Looker Explorer File
Original: No environment separation between production and development, and tables/columns lacked descriptions.
Revised:
Added environment separation to distinguish between production and development instances.
Included clear descriptions for tables and columns in Looker files.
Explanation: Environment separation ensures that changes are safely tested without impacting production data. Adding descriptions to the Looker views and explores enhances documentation, making the data more accessible and understandable for users.
